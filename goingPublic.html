        <h1>Going Public: Out & about with the founder of Public</h1>
       
        <p>
            <img src="images/standard_resolution.jpg.webp" alt="" class="left">
            <strong>Our Story</strong><br/>
            <br/>
            PUBLIC was born out of the deep respect and admiration our founder, Rob Forbes, had<br/>
            for the streets of Amsterdam, which are teeming with bikes and people, not cars. The<br/>
            two-wheeled lifestyle he found in Europe didn't involve special clothing or technical<br/>
            gear. It was simple and practical. People of all ages, in all forms of dress (including<br/>
            casual footwear) were on bikes and enjoying the ride. Our goal is to bring that same<br/>
            freedom to the streets and communities of the US.<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Mass Transit For One</strong><br/>
            <br/>
            Our vision is for a time when we think as carefully about the way we get around on an everyday<br/>
            basis as we do about what we eat, how we dress, and how we furnish our homes. Itâ€™s not a<br/>
            utopian or unrealistic vision.<br/>
            The quality and usage of our public spaces is a measure of the success of our democracy.<br/>
            That is why we call ourselves PUBLIC.<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Design Matters</strong><br/>
            <br/>
            Our bikes are designed to help make city life a little simpler and a little more fun.<br/>
            They're designed with all kinds of people in mind:<br/>
            The everyday bicyclist who regularly rides to work and around town.<br/>
            The person who doesn't identify themselves as bicyclist, but wants a simple, sturdy bicycle<br/>
            for errands, trip to the Farmers Market, or weekend rides in the park.<br/>
            The newbie who is buying an adult bike for the first time who wants to recapture the joy they<br/>
            felt while riding as a child.<br/>
            But most importantly, we design our bikes for ourselves. All of us at PUBLIC are enthusiasts<br/>
            about bicycles for everyday people, and so our high design standard is very simple - we<br/>
            would never produce a bicycle that we wouldn't ride ourselves or recommend to our friends.<br/>
            Our real mission is simply to make our communities more enjoyable.<br/>
